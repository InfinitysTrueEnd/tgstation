changes: 
  - tweak: "The briefcase launchpad can now hold items while in briefcase mode (just like a regular briefcase). Its remote has been disguised as a folder and now spawns pre-linked inside the briefcase."
  - balance: "Increased the briefcase launchpad's range from 3 to 8 tiles, which is roughly half the screen."
